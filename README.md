This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to explore Eleczen.

### Circuit designer concept (`/design/circuit`)

- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/design/circuit](http://localhost:3000/design/circuit) to preview the Tailwind-powered circuit simulator concept.
- The screen showcases:
  - A drag-and-drop inspired component palette grouped by passives, analog intelligence, and power electronics.
  - A clean workspace with a node grid, neon wiring, and theme toggles (realism, minimal, cyber-tech, neon-grid).
  - Simulation controls that outline DC/AC/Transient presets, playback controls, and event timeline chips.
  - Theme identity cards so you can instantly flip between visual vibes for Eleczen presentations.

You can start editing any page by modifying files in `src/app/**`. Changes are hot-reloaded via Next.js.
